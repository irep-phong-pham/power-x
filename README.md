# power-x

Assuming that even in array have duplicate numbers, ( for example [1,2,2,3]), the third largest one is still "1".
Assuming the if array unique elements are less than 3 (invalid input), the program will exit error without answer.

## Result

The first one is naive approach
The second one is O(n) approach
![Result](./img/image.png?raw=true "Result")

## Test

1. Modify the input array generator as you wish
2. Run

```
python run.py
```
